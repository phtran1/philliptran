                    AiBuddy is a collaborative project that I worked on within my Human-Computer Interaction class (CSE440) during Winter 2021, where I collaborated with a team of four students. We learned about the design process, delving into aspects such as performance need-finding, user research, prototyping and user testing to create our final product. Below I've outlined a summary of the problem we aimed to solved and the solution we proposed through AiBuddy, along with the inclusion of our digital prototype.

                <h2>Problem</h2>
                <br>
                <p> 
                    Recognizing the challenges brought by remote learning during COVID-19, we aimed to investigate the main issues that students face especially elementary students.
                    We decided to focus on younger students as our main audience since younger students would have a much more difficult time staying engaged in class compared to older students such as college students. The remote setting for children comes with many distractions and not having a teacher present to keep these students engaged makes it much harder.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Initially, our target group was teachers but after receiving feedback from our surveys we decided to pivot our main focus to the students. Some responses we received from teachers mentioned that students were harder to reach and support in a remote setting and with an online setting teachers need to plan for activities to require minimal materials. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2>Solution</h2>
                <br>
                <p>From our conducted research, we concluded that building an app to help children stay on track with assignments and homework while also being another form of communication with their classmates and teachers would help tackle these issues. We designed AiBuddy with these problems in mind by making an AI that helps support the problems that come with online learning. With this app, our goal was to create an online companion for students to keep track of their school work and get rewarded for completing their tasks.</p>
