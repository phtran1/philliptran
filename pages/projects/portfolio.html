                    Initially starting this website I had prior experiences with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. However I didn't really get to use those tools as much during my time at UW so a lot of the
                    things I learned have become rusty. Also I never really got to learn the basics of those programs. So I decided what better way to learn web development than building a personal portfolio.

                    <br>
                    While working on this website, I had the opportunity to delve into the fundamentals and basics of web development. For example, I learned the importance of styling pages with CSS instead of repeatedly copying and pasting the same information in HTML files. Additionally, I gained a solid understanding of flexboxes and how they can be used to order the structure of different elements on a webpage. These new pieces of information really changed my comprehension and perception of webpage layouts. Now, when I visit websites such as YouTube, I have an idea of how the developers structured their webpage, whereas before, I never really gave it much thought. Exploring these foundational concepts has provided me with valuable insights into web design. 
                    While learning how to build this website I also got explore various tools in web development. I worked with NodeJS initially to run my website, and I considered using Gatsby to build my webpage. However, I wanted to challenge myself by building a website from scratch since this would be my first time doing so. Additionally, I experimented with Bootstrap and I used some of the tools to create a header and footer. But when using this tool I found that the pre-defined styling limited my ability to learn. So, I decided to not to use Bootstrap and instead focused on practicing CSS to style everything I created. This allowed me to gain more experience and control over the visual aspects of my webpage.

                    At the moment I am still working on fixing the structure of some parts of the UI and plan to add more features as I develop this space more. There is a lot more work to be done on this website!
